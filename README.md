# Reminder

While working on codelabs and coming up with ideas for new programs, it can be easy to forget whether or not you fed your dogs!

Why not solve the problem by developing a minimalistic reminder app! It should accomplish the following: 
Just as something comes up you can jot it down and it updates to a list of tasks. 
Edit tasks, incase you misspelled or wrote something down wrong.
Delete tasks as you complete them.
Stretch Goals:
Timed notifications for tasks. 
Username and password management. 

## Design

### Overview
The project will be written in Java. It will use RecyclerView to generate a dynamic list and Room to create a local database. Will also write tests to evaluate the REST methods below.
